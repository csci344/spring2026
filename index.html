                <strong>Intro to the Web</strong>
                <p class="m-top m2">The web and the internet are interconnected systems that facilitate the exchange of data across computers worldwide. Web browsers communicate with servers using the HTTP/HTTPS protocol to fetch and display content, while the internet provides the infrastructure for this communication. Understanding IP addresses, DNS, and how websites are hosted provides a foundation for developing web applications.

                <strong>Design and Accessibility</strong>
                <p class="m-top m2">Design refers to the process of creating an aesthetically pleasing and functional user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). It encompasses layout, typography, color schemes, and interactivity to ensure the site is intuitive,  visually appealing, and accessible. Good design is crucial for engaging users and meeting their needs effectively. While design is a huge topic in its own right, we will briefly review some important design principles, and take a quick look at some design tools and systems.

                <strong>JavaScript: Functional Programming</strong>
                <p class="m-top m2">Functional programming in JavaScript emphasizes the use of pure functions, immutability, and higher-order functions to create predictable and maintainable code. It encourages a declarative style of programming, where the logic of computation is expressed in terms of functions rather than mutable states. This paradigm helps reduce bugs and enhances code reusability.

                <strong>JavaScript: HTTP requests and the Fetch API</strong>
                <p class="m-top m2">The Fetch API is a modern JavaScript interface for making HTTP requests to servers and handling responses. It simplifies fetching resources like JSON data, files, or text from external APIs or web services using promises for asynchronous operations. Understanding how to use the Fetch API, handle response statuses, and work with data formats like JSON is key to building dynamic, data-driven web applications.
