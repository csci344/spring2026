## Overview
In this homework assignment, you will re-implement your HW3 code in React (with a few minor changes to improve the usability of your app). I recommend building from this starter code provided below (which uses Tailwind). That said, feel free to do it your way. I won't be grading you on CSS, but please do make it look nice. You're also welcome to customize the look and feel to make it your own.

<a href="/spring2026/course-files/homework/hw04.zip" class="nu-button">HW4 Starter Code <i class="fas fa-download"></i></a>

When you're done, your React version of the PhotoApp should behave like this one: <a href="https://photo-app-secured.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">https://photo-app-secured.herokuapp.com/</a>. 

## Setup
1. Download and unzip the `hw04` starter files and move them to your `csci344/homework/` directory.
1. Open a terminal and make sure that you are inside the `hw04` directory.
1. Install the node packages as follows: `npm install`
1. Run the React bundler and local server by typing: `npm run dev`
1. Keep this process running while you are developing in React.

## Tasks
In the section below, I've mapped out a suggested implementation strategy. If you implement your React functionality differently, that's fine, but I will be verifying that you did indeed make a series of components (versus just copying your HW3 file into a React folder and only making minor changes). The "AddComment" component can be implemented for extra credit.

            <td>
                Since React uses language features that your browser can't understand, you'll need to "transpile" your code to "vanilla" HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Luckily, Vite can do this for you. Please do the following:
                <ul class="compact">
                    <li>
                        Run the build process from the command line as follows: <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm run build</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>Verify that a new "dist" directory was built.</li>
                    <li>In your "dist" directory, verify that the transpile process worked by previewing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> file like you would any static HTML file (using live server)</li>
                    <li>Link to the transpiled version of your app from your homepage (homework/hw04/dist/index.html).</li>
                </ul>

### Moodle Submission
Please review the requirements above and ensure you have met them. When you're done, please submit the following to the Moodle:

* A link to your GitHub Repository
* A link to your GitHub Pages (which should link to your transpiled `index.html` file in the `dist` directory)
* The name of your partner (if applicable)
* Whether you completed any of the extra credit (so that I can look for it)
