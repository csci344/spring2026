      "options": [
        "<image>",
        "<img>",
        "<picture>",
        "<photo>"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The <img> tag is used to embed images in HTML. It's a self-closing tag that requires attributes like src and alt."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "question": "Which attribute is required for the <img> tag to specify the image source?",
      "options": [
        "source",
        "src",
        "href",
        "link"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The src attribute is required and specifies the path or URL to the image file."

    {
      "id": "q3",
      "question": "What is the purpose of the alt attribute in an <img> tag?",
      "options": [
        "To specify the image file size",
        "To provide alternative text that describes the image for accessibility and when the image fails to load",
        "To set the image alignment",
        "To specify the image format"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The alt attribute provides alternative text that describes the image. It's important for accessibility (screen readers) and displays when the image fails to load."
    },
    {
      "id": "q4",
      "question": "What is the difference between an <img> tag and an <a> tag when it comes to images?",
      "options": [
        "There is no difference",
        "<img> embeds the image in the page, while <a> creates a link that jumps to a new resource",
        "<a> embeds the image, while <img> creates a link",
        "Both tags do the same thing"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The <img> tag embeds an image directly in the web page, while the <a> tag creates a hyperlink that can jump to a new resource (which could be an image, but it would open separately)."
    },
    {
      "id": "q5",
      "question": "What is the correct syntax for an image tag with both src and alt attributes?",
      "options": [
        "<img src=\"photo.jpg\" alt=\"Description\" />",
        "<img src=photo.jpg alt=Description>",
        "<image src=\"photo.jpg\" alt=\"Description\">",
        "<img href=\"photo.jpg\" alt=\"Description\" />"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The correct syntax is <img src=\"photo.jpg\" alt=\"Description\" />. The src attribute specifies the image path, alt provides alternative text, and it's a self-closing tag."
    },
    {
      "id": "q6",
      "question": "Is the alt attribute required for <img> tags?",
      "options": [
        "No, it's optional",
        "Yes, it's always required",
        "Only for certain image types",
        "Only when using relative paths"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The alt attribute is required for <img> tags. It's important for accessibility and should always be included, even if it's an empty string for decorative images."
