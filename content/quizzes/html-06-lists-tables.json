      "question": "What is the difference between <ol> and <ul> tags?",
      "options": [
        "<ol> creates unordered lists, <ul> creates ordered lists",
        "<ol> creates ordered lists (numbered), <ul> creates unordered lists (bulleted)",
        "There is no difference",
        "<ol> is for tables, <ul> is for lists"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "<ol> (ordered list) creates numbered lists, while <ul> (unordered list) creates bulleted lists. Both require <li> tags for each list item."
    },

      "id": "q2",
      "question": "Which tag is used to define individual items in a list?",
      "options": [
        "<item>",
        "<li>",
        "<list-item>",
        "<list>"

      "question": "What are 'compound tags' in the context of lists and tables?",

        "Tags that are deprecated"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Compound tags are tags that work together. For lists, you need <ol> or <ul> to define the list and <li> for each item. For tables, you need multiple tags like <table>, <tr>, and <td> working together."

        "A <div> with <li> tags inside"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A list requires both the container tag (<ol> or <ul>) and at least one list item (<li>). The structure is: <ol><li>Item</li></ol> or <ul><li>Item</li></ul>."
