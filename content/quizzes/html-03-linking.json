    {
      "id": "q1",
      "question": "What is the correct HTML tag for creating a hyperlink?",
      "options": [
        "<link>",
        "<a>",
        "<href>",
        "<url>"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The <a> tag (anchor tag) is used to create hyperlinks in HTML. It requires an href attribute to specify the destination."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "question": "If you're in a file called index.html and want to link to contact.html in the same directory, what is the simplest path you should use?",
      "options": [
        "../contact.html",
        "./contact.html",
        "contact.html",
        "/contact.html"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "When linking to a file in the same directory, the simplest path is just the filename: contact.html. While './contact.html' is also technically correct (the './' explicitly means 'current directory'), it's redundant and 'contact.html' is the more common and simpler approach."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "question": "What does the '../' notation mean in a relative path?",
      "options": [
        "Go to the root directory",
        "Go up one directory level",
        "Go down one directory level",
        "Stay in the current directory"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The '../' notation means 'go up one directory level' (parent directory). For example, if you're in home/index.html and want to access test.html in the parent directory, you'd use ../test.html."
    },
    {
      "id": "q4",
      "question": "Given this directory structure:\n```\nmy_website\n├── home\n│   └── index.html\n└── files\n    └── gallery.html\n```\n\nIf you're editing index.html and want to link to gallery.html, what path should you use?",
      "options": [
        "files/gallery.html",
        "../files/gallery.html",
        "./files/gallery.html",
        "gallery.html"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "You need to go up one directory (../) to reach the parent directory (my_website), then go into the files directory, so the path is ../files/gallery.html."
    },
    {
      "id": "q5",
      "question": "What is an absolute path?",
      "options": [
        "A path relative to the current file",
        "A fully qualified URL including protocol, server name, and file path",
        "A path that starts with ./",
        "A path that only includes the filename"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "An absolute path is a fully qualified URL that includes the protocol (https://), the server name (example.com), and the file path. It's used when linking to resources on other computers/servers."
    },
    {
      "id": "q6",
      "question": "How do you create an internal link (anchor link) that jumps to a specific section on the same page?",
      "options": [
        "Use href='section-name'",
        "Use href='#section-id' with a hash tag followed by the id",
        "Use href='./section-name'",
        "Use href='section-id' without a hash"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Internal links use a hash tag (#) followed by the id of the target element. For example, <a href=\"#section1\">Link</a> will jump to an element with id=\"section1\"."
    },
    {
      "id": "q7",
      "question": "Which attribute is required for the <a> tag to create a functional link?",
      "options": [
        "src",
        "href",
        "link",
        "url"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The href attribute is required for the <a> tag. It specifies the destination URL or path of the link."
    },
    {
      "id": "q8",
      "question": "Given this directory structure:\n```\nmy_website\n└── home\n    ├── index.html\n    └── styles\n        └── my_style.css\n```\n\nIf you're editing index.html and want to link to my_style.css, what path should you use?",

        "styles/my_style.css",
        "./styles/my_style.css",
        "/styles/my_style.css"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Since styles is a subdirectory within the same directory as index.html, you simply use styles/my_style.css to go into the styles directory and access the file."
    },
    {
      "id": "q9",
      "question": "Given this directory structure:\n```\nmy_website\n├── home\n│   ├── index.html\n│   └── about.html\n├── images\n│   └── logo.png\n└── files\n    └── document.pdf\n```\n\nIf you're editing index.html and want to link to logo.png, what path should you use?",

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "You need to go up one directory (../) from home to reach my_website, then go into the images directory, so the path is ../images/logo.png."
