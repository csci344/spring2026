    {
      "id": "q1",
      "question": "According to the AI policy, which of the following uses of generative AI is ALLOWED?",
      "options": [
        "Using AI to look up programming concepts or syntax, similar to using documentation",
        "Using GitHub Copilot to write code for a tutorial",
        "Using ChatGPT to generate a helper function for your homework assignment",
        "Using AI to generate code that you then modify and submit"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "You may use generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) as a reference, similar to documentation or a textbook. This includes looking up programming concepts or syntax, getting explanations of how functions work, understanding error messages, and learning best practices. However, you must write all submitted code yourself."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "question": "What is the rule of thumb for determining if your use of AI is permitted?",
      "options": [
        "If you understand the AI-generated code, it's allowed",
        "If you could not reasonably reproduce the solution without referring back to the AI's output, then the use is not permitted",
        "If the AI tool is free to use, it's allowed",
        "If you modify the AI-generated code, it's allowed"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The rule of thumb states: If you could not reasonably reproduce the solution without referring back to the AI's output, then the use is not permitted. This helps you determine whether your use of AI crosses the line from reference to code generation."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "question": "What must you do with AI-powered code completion features in your code editor (like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Tabnine) when working on course assignments?",
      "options": [
        "You can use them for tutorials but not homework",
        "You can use them if you understand the generated code",
        "You must disable them completely",
        "You can use them as long as you only accept a few suggestions"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "You must disable AI-powered code completion and generation features in your code editor (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Copilot Chat, Cursor, Tabnine, Codeium) while working on course assignments. Accidental use still counts as a violation, even if you only accept a few suggestions."
    },
    {
      "id": "q4",
      "question": "What happens if you unintentionally violate the AI policy and contact the instructor BEFORE submitting the assignment?",
      "options": [
        "The issue can often be resolved in a learning-focused way without triggering formal penalties",
        "You automatically receive a grade of 0 on the assignment",
        "No action is taken",
        "You receive a grade of F in the course"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "If you believe you may have violated this policy unintentionally, or you are unsure whether a particular use of AI crossed the line, you must contact the instructor before submitting the assignment. In many cases, early and honest disclosure allows resolution in a learning-focused way (such as revising the work or completing an alternative assignment) without triggering formal penalties."

        "Cases where you're unsure if you crossed the line",
        "Early disclosure of potential violations",
        "Intentional misuse of AI tools",
        "Unintentional violations disclosed before submission"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The disclosure pathway does not apply to cases of intentional misuse, repeated violations, or undisclosed AI use discovered after submission. Once an assignment is submitted, any undisclosed violations will be handled according to the enforcement policy."
    },
    {
      "id": "q11",
      "question": "According to the AI policy, what is the key principle about code submission?",
      "options": [
        "You can use AI to generate code as long as you cite it",
        "AI-generated code is allowed for tutorials but not homework",
        "All code you submit must be your own",
        "All code must be written by you, but you can use AI-generated code if you understand it"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The fundamental principle is that all code you submit must be your own. Copying, pasting, or adapting AI-generated code is considered academic dishonesty. AI may help you understand code, but you must write all submitted code yourself."

        "It's allowed for tutorials but not homework",
        "It counts as a violation, even if accidental",
        "It's fine as long as you understand the code"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Accidental use still counts as a violation, even if you only accept a few suggestions. You must disable AI-powered code completion features in your code editor while working on course assignments. It is your responsibility to ensure these features are turned off before beginning work."
    },
    {
      "id": "q14",

    {
      "id": "q16",
      "question": "What percentage of your final grade comes from exams?",
      "options": [
        "40%",
        "20%",
        "35%",
        "30%"
