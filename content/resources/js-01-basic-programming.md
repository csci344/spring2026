For those of you who are rusty on programming, please complete the following "crash course" on programming. The course covers some of the basic concepts in computer programming using JavaScript. After taking a look at these resources, please complete the practice exercises using Node.js:

1. [Data](#step1)
1. [Expressions & Statements](#step2)
1. [Control](#step3)
1. [Arrays](#step4)
1. [Objects & Classes](#step5)

## 1. Data
### Data Types
JavaScript has 8 data types. Each datatype has particular capabilities and behaviors that are important to understand:

| | Type | Description | Example |
|--|--|--|--|
| 1 | number  | For numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point| 1.4, 33, 99999999 |
| 2 | bigint  | For storing very large integers that can't be represented by the number datatype | BigInt("123456789012345678901234567890") |
| 3 | string | For strings (text). A string may have one or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type | "hello world!" |
| 4 | boolean | for true/false. | true, false |
| 5 | null | for unknown values – has a single value null | null |
| 6 | undefined | for unassigned values – has a single value undefined | undefined |
| 7 | object | for more complex data structures.| { name: "ralph", species: "dog" } | 
| 8 | symbol | for unique identifiers (we won’t be using this one) | |
 
#### Use the `typeof` operator to figure out the type of data you have...

```js
console.log(typeof "hello world!");
console.log(typeof true);
console.log(typeof false);
console.log(typeof null);
console.log(typeof undefined);
console.log(typeof 23.4);
console.log(typeof 4500);
console.log(typeof [1, 3, 4, 6]);
console.log(typeof { name: "Lester", species: "dog", age: 15});
```

#### Use the built-in data type classes to convert between data types...

```js
// String(), Number(), Boolean()
// 1. Convert a number to a string
let myString = String(123); // number is an argument

// 2. Convert a string to a number:
let myNum = Number("123");

// 3. Convert a string to a boolean
console.log(Boolean("true"), typeof Boolean("true"));
```

### Variables

* Variables are containers for storing and / or referencing data
* Variables can also be used to assign an alias to a function, variable, object, or class
* Variables are created by using a declaration keyword (var, const, or let)
* Variables can be declared and assigned within the same statement, or they can be separated
* You assign values to variables using the assignment operator (equal sign)
* Variables are **case-sensitive**
* While the JavaScript interpreter doesn't care what you name things, variable names are typically mnemonic and "camel case" in JavaScript


JavaScript is a *dynamically typed language*, which means that you don't need to explicitly declare the type of a variable when you create it. The type is determined automatically based on the value assigned to the variable, and it can change as the program runs. For instance:

```js
let myVar = 42;              // variable is a number
console.log(typeof myVar);   // "number"

myVar = "Hello, world!";     // now variable is a string
console.log(typeof myVar);   // "string"

myVar = true;                // now variable is a boolean
console.log(typeof myVar);   // "boolean"
```

In the example above, `myVar` starts out as a number data type (line 1), then changes to a string (line 4), and then changes to a boolean (line 7).


#### Sample Naming Conventions (Mnemonic & Camel Case)
```js
// variable names:
let timeLeftTilEndOfClass = 35;
let firstName = "Jazmin";
let lastName = "Morales";
```

#### Declaring Variables
In JavaScript, there are three keywords for declaring variables: let, const, and var.

**`let`**
Means that the variable may be reassigned / can be changed.

**`const`**
Means that the variable won"t be reassigned. It’s "immutable." Used in cases where you declare and assign once, but don’t change it afterwards.

**`var`**
For this class: try to avoid (o)ld way to do things prior to ES6). This is not because of efficiency, but because of communication -- “The weakest signal available”. When you see it, it's kind of ambiguous:
* "The variable may or may not be reassigned" (who knows!?)
* "The variable may or may not be needed on the global object (`window`)

## 2. Expressions & Statements

### Expressions
An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value (after it is evaluated by an interpreter). Some examples of expressions that all resolve to the value `9`:

```js
let myVar = 9;          // 9 is a "constant" expression. Cannot be simplified further
myVar = 11 - 2;     // 11 - 2 and 3 * 3 are expressions involving arithmetic operators
myVar = 3 * 3;
```
Expressions are evaluated to their simplest form by the JavaScript interpreter before moving onto the next statement.

### Statements
A statement *performs an action* while an expression *produces a value*. Some examples of statements include:

```js
let var1;
var1 = 40;
if (var1 > 5) { ... }
```
In the code block above:
* line 1 declares a new variable (names it and allocates some memory for storage)
* line 2 assigns the value 40 to the variable var1
* line 3 checks if the expression inside the parenthesis is true or false


### Operators
Operators perform fairly simple tasks (addition, subtraction, comparison, assignment, etc.). The operators shown below typically require two  (operands) and 

#### Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Meaning | Description | 
|--|--|--|
| + | Addition | Adds values on either side of the operator | 
| - | Subtraction | Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand | 
| * | Multiplication | Multiplies values on either side of the operator | 
| / | Division | Divides left hand operand by right hand operand | 
| ** | Exponent | Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators | 
| % | Modulus | Divides left hand operand by right hand operand; returns remainder | 
| ++ | Increment | Adds 1 to the number | 
| -- | Decrement | Subtracts 1 from the number |

#### Comparison Operators
Comparison operators always evaluate to `true` or `false` and are often used with if/else statements and loops.

| Operator | Meaning |
|--|--|
| == | Equality |
| === | Strict Equality (both values and data types match) |
| != | Not Equal |
| >, >= | Greater than; greater than or equal to |
| <, <= | Less than; Less than or equal to |

See <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_comparisons.asp" target="_blank">W3 Schools</a> for more information and examples.

#### Logical Operators

| Operator | Meaning | Explanation |
|--|--|
| && | and | If both operands are true, then the "and expression" also evaluates to true. Otherwise, the "and expression" evaluates to false. | 
| \|\| | or | If either or both of the operands are true, then the "or expression" also evaluates to true. Otherwise, the "or expression" evaluates to false.  |
| ! | not | if the operand is false, then the "not" of the operand is true (and vice versa). |

#### Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. Here are some of the most common assignment operators:

| Operator | Meaning | Explanation |
|--|--|
| = | assignment | Assign the value on the right of the `=` to the variable on the left of the `=`. | 
| += | add and assign | Adds the value of a variable by a specified value and then assigns the result back to that variable.  |
| -= | subtract and assign | Subtracts the value of a variable by a specified value and then assigns the result back to that variable.  |
| *= | multiply and assign | Multiplies the value of a variable by a specified value and then assigns the result back to that variable.  |
| /= | divide and assign | Divides the value of a variable by a specified value and then assigns the result back to that variable.  |

Examples:

```js
let x = 5;
x += 3;         // Adds 3 to the value stored in x and then reassigns the result to x
console.log(x); // Outputs 8

x -= 2;         // Subtracts 2 from the value stored in x and ressigns the result to x
console.log(x); // Outputs 6

x *= 4;         // Multiplies the value stored in x by 4 and ressigns the result to x
console.log(x); // Outputs 24

x /= 3;         // Dividies the value stored in x by 3 and ressigns the result to x
console.log(x); // Outputs 8
```


### Functions
* Functions are a way to encapsulate and re-use code
* With functions, you can perform the same operations over and over using different data
* JavaScript has many built-in functions
* You can also create your own functions

There are many syntaxes for creating functions that perform a little bit differently:

#### Function Declarations

```js
function addTwoNums(num1, num2) {
   	return num1 + num2;
}
```

#### Arrow Functions

```js
const nameOfFunction = (parameters) => {
    statement 1;
    statement 2;
    ...
    return someValue; //optional
};
```

#### Differences
Some notable distinctions between arrow functions and function declarations:
* Function declarations are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvfRXyKa_GI" target="_blank">hoisted</a>. Arrow functions are not.
* You can't use arrow functions as class methods (doesn't honor the "this" keyword)


#### Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|--|--|
| arguments | the data that you pass into a function |
| parameters | local variables, inside a function, that are assigned when the function is invoked |
| function definition | tells you which parameters are required and which are optional (if any) |
| function body | the statements that are executed when a function is invoked |
| return value | The data that is returned from a function (optional) |

## 3. Control
In programming, **control** refers to the techniques that determine the flow of execution of a program. This includes the order in which statements, instructions, or functions are executed based on conditions, loops, or other control structures.
### If...Else

#### `if` Statement
The `if` statement is the most basic form of conditional control. It checks a condition, and if the condition evaluates to true, the block of code within the `if` statement is executed. Example:

```js
let age = 20;
if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");  // This code runs because the condition is true
}
```

#### `else` Statement
The `else` statement is used in conjunction with the `if` statement. It defines a block of code that will be executed if the condition in the `if` statement evaluates to false. Example: 

```js
let age = 16;
if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("You are an adult.");
} else {
    console.log("You are a minor.");  // This code runs because the condition is false
}
```

#### `if/else if/else` Statement
The `if/else if/else` statement is used when you need to check multiple conditions. You start with an `if` statement, followed by one or more `else if` statements to check additional conditions. If none of the conditions are true, the `else` block (if included) is executed as a fallback. Example:

```js
let score = 85;

if (score >= 90) {
    console.log("Grade: A");
} else if (score >= 80) {
    console.log("Grade: B");  // This code runs because the score is between 80 and 89
} else if (score >= 70) {
    console.log("Grade: C");
} else {
    console.log("Grade: D or lower");
}
```

### Loops
In JavaScript, loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. JavaScript provides several types of loops to handle different looping scenarios:

#### `while` Loop
The while loop repeats a block of code as long as the specified condition evaluates to true. It is ideal for situations where the number of iterations is not known beforehand. Example:

```js
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log(i);  // Outputs 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
    i++;
}
```
Note that in the example above...
1. Statements on lines 3 and 4 keep repeating until the `i < 5` condition is no longer true. In other words, eventually the value stored in the variable `i` will be 5 or greater, making the `i < 5` expression false.
2. If the counter `i` is not incremented each time the code block executes, the loop will never terminate. In other words, the loop will never break and the code block will keep printing `0` because the value of `i` never changes.


#### `for` Loop
The for loop is the most commonly used loop. It repeats a block of code a specified number of times, based on the initialization, condition, and iteration expressions. Example: 

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);  // Outputs 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
}
```
Note that in the example above...
1. The first statement (`let i = 0`) in the loop header runs **before the loop begins**,
2. The second statement (`i < 5`) is checked **before entering the loop** on every iteration, and 
3. The third statement (`i++`) runs at the end of every iteration

#### 3.2.3. `for...of` Loop
The `for...of` loop is used to iterate over the values of an iterable object (e.g., arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc.). It provides a more straightforward syntax for iterating over array elements and other iterable objects without having to manually index the iterable object. Example:

```js
const myArray = ["dog", "cat", "bird", "fish"];

for (let item of myArray) {
    console.log(item);  // Outputs dog, cat, bird, fish
}
```

## 4. Arrays
Arrays in JavaScript are objects used to store multiple values in a single variable. They can hold elements of any type, including numbers, strings, objects, other arrays, and more. They also provide various methods for managing and manipulating collections of data. 

There are numerous resources that go over key array methods and approaches. That said, make sure you understand how to...
1. Create, read, modify, add, and remove elements from an array. 
2. Some commonly used JavaScript array methods (see video below).

Here is an example of some common JavaScript array uses:

```js
// Create an array
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];

// Add elements to the array
fruits.push("date");         // Adds "date" to the end of the array
fruits.unshift("apricot");   // Adds "apricot" to the beginning of the array
console.log("After adding elements:", fruits); 
// Outputs: ["apricot", "apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]

// Remove elements from the array
fruits.pop();                // Removes the last element ("date")
fruits.shift();              // Removes the first element ("apricot")
console.log("After removing elements:", fruits); 
// Outputs: ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

// Access elements in the array
console.log("First element:", fruits[0]);   // Outputs: "apple"
console.log("Second element:", fruits[1]);  // Outputs: "banana"

// Modify elements in the array
fruits[1] = "blueberry";    // Change the second element to "blueberry"
console.log("After modifying elements:", fruits); 
// Outputs: ["apple", "blueberry", "cherry"]

// Delete elements from the array
delete fruits[0];           // Deletes the first element, leaves an undefined hole
console.log("After deleting an element:", fruits); 
// Outputs: [undefined, "blueberry", "cherry"]
```
