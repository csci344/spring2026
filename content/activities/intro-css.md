Please download the exercise files (below).

Then, use the CSS Property Cheatsheet (below) and what you've learned about selectors to make the following drawing:

<img class="large" src="/spring2026/images/activities/intro-css/gallery.png" />

### Tips

| Property | Tip |
|--|--|
| body * { <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;border: solid 1px black;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;padding: 5px;<br>} | To make debugging easier, turn on the borders for all elements (temporarily). |  
| display: inline-block | By default, tags like `div`, `section`, `article`, etc. are `display: block;` which means that there's a line break. If you don't want this, use: `display: inline-block` |

### Some extra challenges (if you have time)
1. Make one of the image "cards" have a different background color.
2. Try using a custom Google font instead of one of the built-in system fonts. Resources to consult:

3. Make a hover effect using a "pseudoclass": when your user mouses over one the cards, make it do something (fade, grow, change colors, etc.). We will go over this in a future lesson, but in the meantime, you can take a look at W3 Schools:
