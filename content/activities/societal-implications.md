## 1. Joan is Awful

### Everyone: General Reflections

1. What was most memorable / relatable about the episode? 
2. How have advances in computation, data collection, and networking (via the Internet) made this world possible?
3. In what ways do you think this fictional world already exists in real life? Who is most impacted?
4. Consider how different people might experience this world differently: celebrities, politicians, children, young people, people belonging to non-dominant social categories relating to race, gender identity, religion?  


### Group 1: Identity

When Joan is Awful airs on Streamberry, an exaggerated version of Joan's identity of "Source Joan" is put on display for all to see (and judge).

1. What are some examples of a person's story / everyday experiences / identity being made public either without their permission or in a way that doesn't reflect the truth? See if you can come up with a few different examples…
2. Consider different mediums (e.g., YouTube, TikTok, video / photo / document leaks, deep fakes, tabloids, journalism, etc.).
3. Who is this most likely to happen to? Are certain social groups (think age, class, race, gender, political affiliation, disability, etc.) more likely to be targeted? See if you can come up with some examples?
4. Before the Internet / AI, do you think it was easier or harder for people to control the narrative around their identities? 
5. What is the "same as it always was"? Or has the Internet / AI enabled something fundamentally different? 
6. In what ways might people have more control over how they are portrayed in the media? In other words, can you think of some examples of how technologies have been or could be used to resist common tropes and stereotypes about people and social groups?


### Group 2: Privacy

1. How is Streamberry capturing Joan's life for all to see? 
2. What technologies and social practices are in place that make this possible?
3. Do you think she could reasonably opt out of this?
4. When she goes to see her lawyer, what does the lawyer say? Why can't she sue them / get them to stop?
5. Connect Joan's (Annie Murphy) privacy dilemma to the real world: How much data is being collected about your behavior (and where is it coming from)? How much control do you have over this? Beyond having a Netflix series dedicated to ridiculing your life, what are some other harms that can come from ubiquitous data collection?
6. Why is this data capture happening? What benefits does it provide to companies, governments, etc.?
7. What regulations / rules are in place to protect privacy? In the U.S.? Abroad?


### Group 3: Creative & Skilled Work

1. How are Selma Hayek's concerns over Streamberry similar to and different from Joan's?
2. In minute 42 of the episode, Selma tells Joan: "They have taken 100 years of cinema and diminished it to an app. I'm going to go and take that computer and rip the cables out of it..."
3. How do Selma's concerns relate to the concerns of other artists, videographers, actors, musicians, etc., given recent advances in generative AI?
4. Is it possible to unmake generative AI and "go back" to a time where this wasn't possible? Is "ripping out the cables" a viable solution?
5. Before Big Data, Generative AI, and the Internet, there were other technological disruptions that affected other kinds of creative work:
6. What is the origin of the term "Luddite" (Google it or ask ChatGPT)? What did the Luddites do? Were they successful?
7. There's a phrase that's been "in the air" this year that says, ChatGPT, DALL-E, and other tools "get you to good enough faster" (not necessarily "good" – but "good enough"). What are the pros and cons of a "good enough faster" kind of world?

### Group 4: "Engagement"

Consider the following interaction in minute 47:00 of the episode:

> Streamberry CEO: "Our goal is to create unique, tailored content to each individual in our database. All 800 million of them. The most relatable content imaginable."
> 
> Journalist: But why awful? Why is it all so negative?
> 
> Streamberry CEO: "No, that's a great question, Fatima. We did try more affirmative content in our test…but we found that our subjects didn't buy it. It didn't jive with their neurotic view of themselves. When we focused on their more weak or selfish or craven moments…and put them in a state of mesmerized horror – which really drives engagement – they literally can't look away."

1. Why are media companies so concerned with "engagement" – how does it help them? Be as specific as you can.
2. How has engagement with media changed with the evolution of the Internet? Is this a good thing? A bad thing? Both?
3. Do you agree with the Streamberry CEO that the most engaging, relatable content is negative?
4. "Personalization" is a term that typically has a positive spin. What are the pros and cons of having content delivered to you that is "personalized." What does "personal" mean to a platform?


## 2. Readings 

### 2.1. Net Neutrality (after federal court struck down FCC rules)
1. What are the main legal reasons the federal appeals court gave for striking down the FCC’s net neutrality rules, and how might this shape future internet regulation in the United States? 
2. How might the absence of federal net neutrality protections affect different groups of internet users (e.g., consumers, small businesses, content creators)? 
3. In what ways could states step in to protect net neutrality in the absence of federal authority, and what challenges might state-level regulation face?
4. Should Congress pass a federal law explicitly protecting net neutrality? Why or why not, given the competing interests of ISPs and consumer advocates?
5. How does classifying broadband as a common carrier versus an information service influence regulatory authority and outcomes?


## 2.2. Meta Fact-Checking Shift (Zuckerberg & Trump)

1. What reasons did Meta’s CEO give for ending traditional third-party fact-checking, and what are potential benefits and risks of this change? 
2. How might Meta’s move away from professional fact-checking toward alternatives like crowd-sourced “Community Notes” impact misinformation and public trust? 
3. In what ways could political pressure or relationships between tech leaders and government officials influence a company’s content moderation policies? 
4. What responsibilities, if any, should social media companies have in balancing free expression with preventing harmful or false content?{index=9}  
5. How do changes in Meta’s fact-checking practices intersect with broader concerns about disinformation, elections, and civic engagement? 


## 2.3. U.S. –EU Tech Regulation Fight

1. What are the main points of contention between the United States and the European Union over technology regulation (e.g., data privacy, competition, platform responsibilities)?
2. How do differing regulatory philosophies in the U.S. and EU reflect broader cultural or political attitudes toward tech governance?
3. What are potential economic and geopolitical consequences if the U.S. and EU continue on divergent paths in regulating big tech? 
4. Should transatlantic cooperation on tech regulation be a priority? Why or why not? 
5. How might regulatory battles between the U.S. and EU shape the future of digital markets, competition, and user rights globally?
